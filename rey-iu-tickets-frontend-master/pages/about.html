            <strong>1929-1946: The beginnings of the club :</strong><br><br><br>
            In the 1920s, young Kabyles who played football in the streets of the city of Tizi-Ouzou organized a mini inter-district championship under the leadership of Ahmed Astouati. Each district of the upper town (the indigenous town, taddart or tribe) had its team; participated in this tournament, young people from the districts of Aïn Hallouf, Tazegourt, Ihammoutène, Zellal and Tabnahlit. It is from these neighborhoods that a group of young people will emerge who aspired to the creation of a football club different from the 'Olympique de Tizi-Ouzou', a club created by the Europeans of Algeria. These young people formed a neighborhood selection made up of brothers Mesbahi Saïd and Ramdane, brothers Sebti Samir and Sofiane and brothers Rafaï Mohamed and Hocine, Harchaoui Omar, Zemirli Saïd, Souibes Rabah, Loukab Mohamed, Mekacher Amar, Boussad Ouamar, Mammar Mohamed, cousins Hammoutène Abderezak and Mohamed, Belhadj Khelifa, Chabaraka Ahmed, Assas Hocine, grouped around their dean Chikhaoui Mohamed Seghir then aged twenty, to create a sports society in order to participate in an official championship. <br><br>

            From the beginning of the year 1929 and after many difficulties, the young Kabyles who had come together to form a sports association, managed to finalize and file their status. The sports company called Rapid Club de Tizi-Ouzou was born, the name of the association was borrowed from the Austrian club Rapid Vienne, as well as its colors: green and white. The declaration of the association also appears in the JORF. For the costs of commitments to the championship of the season 1929-1930 and the purchase of equipment, each member brought back his own equipment (shoes, stockings, shorts). As for the jerseys and the expenses, they were the object of a quest from their parents, allies and friends and from certain notables of the village. The football was bought and graciously donated by Chikhaoui Mohamed Seghir, team captain. <br><br>
            The 1930-1931 season was full of promise, the sporting results were encouraging; the young people and the association were starting to be talked about in the region. This beginning of notoriety aroused some questions among the leaders of the OTO who were not long in manifesting themselves during the 1931-1932 season. They approached the leaders of the RCTO in order to integrate them into the ranks of the OTO while showing interest in certain players. Finally no longer being able to support themselves with their derisory means, the young people of the Rapid could not ensure the start of the 1932-1933 season and had to forfeit and dissolve their sports society. Faced with the insistence and threats of the leaders of the OTO and some local elected officials, some players joined the OTO, others the Jeunesse Sportive Isserville-Les Issers, while others again put an end to their adventure. <br><br>
            <strong>Sidi Said Hanafi's attempt (1942-1943) :</strong> <br><br><br>
            It was not until ten years after the dissolution of the Rapid Club of Tizi-Ouzou that there was talk of the creation of an "indigenous" football club in the city of Tizi-Ouzou, following the installation of Master Sidi Saïd Hanafi, criminal lawyer, in the rue Saint-Eustache in 1942. His meeting with some nationalist personalities who gathered at the bookseller Keddache Youcef, made it possible to relaunch the project of creation of a sports society, called Association Sportive de Kabylie (ASK) representing the whole region, replacing the former Rapid society which had lacked the support of its leaders. The idea began to take shape and Sidi Saïd Hanafi was given the task of initiating the procedure for creating the sports company by preparing the statutes and compiling an approval file. Former Rapid and OTO players were approached to be part of the new company, but following the death of Sidi Hanafi in July 1943, the project fell apart. stopped. <br>
            The project was taken over by a group of former Olympique de Tizi-Ouzou players, who attempted to complete the affiliation arrangements players. <br>
            The massacres of Sétif, Guelma and Kherrata jeopardized this project: less than a week later, on 14 May 1945, an order was promulgated in which a prohibition on any Muslim from creating a association and to come together is imposed. Indeed, nationalist militants from the Comité d'Action Révolutionnaire Nord-Africain had infiltrated the various cultural and sports associations to promote the idea of independence, following the events that occurred in Setif. The fear was then that it would immediately be assimilated to a plot aimed at state security. Finally, in order to calm things down, on 20 January 1946 the ban on Muslims creating associations was lifted: with this gesture the French administration tried to restore order and ease tensions within the country. <br> <br>

            <strong>The creation of the Sports Youth of Kabylia (1946) :</strong><br><br><br>
            
            During the year 1946, the union section of the CGT of Tizi Ouzou launched the project to create a football club in the corporate setting. Alongside this initiative, some young "natives" from the same locality who practice this sport and are interested in the project, jump at the chance to speed up the process. Contacts were very quickly made and a few meetings were thus organized at the CGT headquarters, chaired by Hamouda Abbas with the sponsorship of Saadi Ouakli, a retired former school principal and president of the district's veterans. The latter, well known and respected by the colonial authorities, was often called upon to chair conciliation meetings or meetings of civil society on the right or on the left. The colonial authorities did not lend too much interest to these groupings for union purposes and the creation of a football team within the corporative framework did not risk any inconvenience.
            <br><br>
            At the end of the last meeting held at the headquarters of the CGT with the aim of finalizing the project by preparing the statutes with the constitution of the first general assembly of the club, a questioning of the objective of the creation of the new sports society divided the leaders and the young people. Indeed, the latter proposed rather the affiliation of the future company to the FFFA instead of making it a corporate team. This discrepancy angered Abbas, who threatened to withdraw and at the same time to deprive the future sports association of its domicile as well as the elements of the CGT. Nevertheless, after a final debate, he invited all the actors present to finalize the preparation of the constitution of the sports society and to leave the choice of the objective to the members of the assembly. <br><br>
            On 29 July 1946, the session is chaired by Abbas Hamouda, member of the CGT, and after a debate, the members present agreed on the creation of an omnisports civil society within the civil framework representing the youth of Kabylia. Thus the sports association would bear the name of Jeunesse Sportive de Kabylie (JSK) after having rejected those of "Association Sportive de Kabylie" and "Union Sportive Musulmane de Tizi-Ouzou", and the colors retained are green and red. Affiliation would be with the FFFA in the civilian context and two teams (senior and reserve) would be involved in competitions. <br><br>
            Among the members of the CGT present at this meeting, Hamouda Abbas who wanted to make the club a sports company with a corporate purpose and therefore an affiliation to the FSGT, signified his disagreement and the withdrawal of his institution. This resulted in the refusal of domiciliation of the new sports company at the headquarters of the CGT. Mohamed Seghir Baïleche offered his commercial premises to house the headquarters of the new association while waiting to find something better, and so the “Café de la Jeunesse” served as a gathering place for the JSK. A few days later, on 2 August 1946[A 2], the club is officially founded as an association whose decision is published in the No. 196 edition of the Official Journal of the French Republic published on 22 on page 7348; as well as to the FFFA under number 8153.
            <br><br>
            The year 1946 therefore saw the beginnings of the club in competition at Tizi Ouzou at the Arsène Weinmann stadium, which began in a particular context because it was the first season since the end of World War II, after years of regional criteriums.
